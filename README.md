## Wiki

<details>
<summary>1. FirstTime Use</summary>

- After the module is installed for the first time, **please first** add your subscription URL in  
  `/data/adb/box_bll/clash/config.yaml`, or do it via the Web Desktop App  
  (**Note: SurfingTile must be invoked and Root permission is required**), then manually reboot your device once.
- After rebooting, toggle the module switch once, open the **Web App** on your desktop, and you can start using it.
- Due to network issues, not all **rules**/**subscriptions** may download automatically; please manually refresh them in the panel.
- If subscriptions fail to load, try switching the **Ua** in the configuration file.
- If the above fails, ensure your network environment is normal.

- Web App:
    - Can be used via Menu → Config Override → Fill in subscription
    - Used for portable browsing and managing backend routing data

<summary>5. Usage Issues</summary>

### Proxy Specific Apps (Blacklist / Whitelist)

- To proxy all apps except certain ones, open `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config`,  
  set `proxy_mode` to `blacklist` (default), and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array.  
  The element format is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces.  
  These apps will **not** be proxied.  
  Example: `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")`

- To proxy only specific apps, open `/data/adb/box_bll/scripts/box.config`,  
  set `proxy_mode` to `whitelist`, and add elements to the `user_packages_list` array.  
  The element format is `id:package_name`, separated by spaces.  
  Only these apps will be proxied.  
  Example: `user_packages_list=("id:package_name" "id:package_name")`

Android user group IDs:

| User Type       | ID  |
| --------------- | --- |
| Owner           | 0   |
| Phone Clone     | 10  |
| Multiple Apps   | 999 |

> You can usually find all user group IDs and app package names under `/data/user/`.

### Tun Mode
- Disabled by default
- When using blacklist/whitelist, exclude the corresponding package names

> Can be enabled or disabled manually via configuration if needed.

### Routing Rules
- Optimized for Mainland China
- Meets most daily usage requirements

> With increasingly robust routing rules, blacklist/whitelist is becoming less necessary.

### Panel Management
- Magisk font modules

> May affect proper display of panel fonts.

### LAN Sharing
- Enable hotspot to allow other devices to connect
- Tun Gateway: `172.20.0.1`

> To access the backend console from other devices:  
> `http://<CurrentWiFi>/<TunGateway>:9090/ui`

### Host File
- No need to mount: just delete the file
- To remount: create a new one in the **etc folder**
- All changes take effect immediately
- During update/installation, you can use volume keys Up(**Mount**) / Down(**Unmount**) to choose

> Local IP redirection for domains, forced binding

<summary>6. SurfingTile App</summary>

### Quick Settings Tile Service

### 📱 Device Requirements
> Supports Android 10+

- Must run in **system space** and require **Root** permission
- For **KSU** users, you need to install the **"Meta Module"** to obtain mount permissions
- The tile works entirely based on the **Clash API**, please check if the API settings are correct
  - **Path:** → Web App → Menu → Tile Settings

- **Partial workflow diagrams**

## EasyTier

- Surfing starts EasyTier alongside Mihomo and connects to it through the SOCKS5 service at `127.0.0.1:11080`
- The EasyTier configuration file is located at `/data/adb/box_bll/easytier/config.toml`
- The default configuration uses `my-network`, `my-secret`, and `tcp://8.152.217.157:11010`; change these fields when using another EasyTier network
- TUN and IPv4/IPv6 STUN are disabled by default; restart the Surfing service after changing the EasyTier configuration
- Select `EasyTier` from Total Mode or any routing policy group to send traffic through the EasyTier network
